# Full-Convolutional-Time-Series-Flow

Welcome to the repository containing the implementation of algorithms from the paper titled *'A Flow-Based Model for Conditional and Probabilistic Electricity Consumption Profile Generation and Prediction'.*

## Tutorials

To get started with our models and understand how they work, we have prepared several tutorials. Please click on the links below to explore them:

**Conditional Generation** [Conditional Generation Tutorial](tutorial_conditioanl_gen.ipynb): (**Beginner friendly**) This tutorial guides you through generating electricity consumption profiles conditionally.

**Unconditional Generation** [Unconditional Generation Tutorial](tutorial_uncond_gen.ipynb): Learn how to generate electricity consumption profiles without specific conditions.

**Prediction** [Prediction Tutorial](tutorial_prediction.ipynb): Dive into predicting future electricity consumption profiles based on past data.

We highly recommend going through these tutorials in the order listed above to gain a comprehensive understanding of the models and their applications. Especially **Conditional Generation** tutorial.
